"But truth be told, it wasn‚Äôt just any message. I had done my homework, meticulously scrolling through her profile, piecing together the puzzle of who she was. And every detail only deepened my belief that I had found the woman of my dreams."+
"Her beauty, both inside and out, is captivating. She‚Äôs effortlessly charming, magnetic in her charisma, and her intelligence leaves me in awe. Her energy is infectious, and before I knew it, I was drawn to her like a moth to a flame. Sliding into her DM wasn‚Äôt just a choice‚Äîit was DESTINY!!!",

We had made plans, talked endlessly, and now the moment to finally meet had come. I was buzzing with anticipation, imagining what it would be like to see, touch, and hold him after all these while."+
"It was around 7am, and I found myself at the International wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, waiting with my heart racing. How would I react? What would it be like to finally hold hands with this man who had been a virtual part of my life for so long?"+
"Then, I saw him‚Ä¶"+
"\n\n\t       The moment I caught sight of him, all my nerves disappeared. I just lost it, I ran to him like a child who had found her long lost treasure. Wrapped in his warm embrace, I could hardly believe it. There he was, a real man, so handsome, with a smile that melted my heart, the perfume he wore swept me off my feet. He leaned in, clearly wanting to kiss me, and I couldn‚Äôt help but playfully curve him üòÇ but deep down, I was absolutely over the moon.",
        description2:"I never saw it coming, not even for a moment. You know that feeling when you watch future brides on social media get engaged, and they break down in tears?

What was meant to be her intimate dinner date to serenade her new lover turned into something far more extraordinary a proposal, her proposal. I had envisioned this moment countless times, dreaming of how perfect it would be, but nothing could have prepared me for the overwhelming joy of that night.",
        description4:"I managed to gather the most important people in her life, all without her having the slightest clue. It was seamless, magical, the kind of surprise that leaves a lasting glow in the heart. I‚Äôve always believed that proposals should be spontaneous, a moment of pure, genuine emotion that sparks a new chapter in a love story.",
        description5:"And here she was, this treasure I have found, a beautiful soul, a virtuous woman. She‚Äôs God fearing, incredibly intelligent, and brimming with life. She fills every corner of my world with light and complements me in every possible way. There was no doubt in my mind I had found my oxygen, the one who makes my heart beat stronger.",
        description6:"With confidence and love in my heart, I looked into her eyes, and without hesitation, I asked the question: ‚ÄúWill you marry me?‚Äù",
        description7:"And she said yes.",
        toast:"They say meeting the right person is the key to unlocking great doors, well, I‚Äôm a living proof of that. They say love is a beautiful thing, but without BREATHE, you cannot experience it. Here's to the Oxygens that keeps us alive and in love. Cheers to usü•Ç."
